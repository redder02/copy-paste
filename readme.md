## How to Run

1. Install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. In the root folder, run the file `app.py` and note the second URL that is displayed in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ``` 

3. Ensure both your laptop and mobile device are connected to the same network (e.g., same Wi-Fi or router).

4. Enter the URL you noted earlier into the browser on your mobile device.

5. Now, everything you copy on your laptop will be available on your mobile as well.
